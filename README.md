The project runs on both Android and Web platforms. 

The Android App is a platform for students to learn and interact among
themselves through chat (text and image messaging). The users need to authenticate with their Gmail or email. Then they can discuss their doubts and
questions among themselves in a common chat room for each question as well as for each subject in their curriculum. New rooms for new questions can be
created.
